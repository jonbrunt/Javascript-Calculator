# javascript_calculator
A JavaScript calculator written in plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, allows for toggling of negative assignment on numbers, allows for clearing of current entry, resetting the calculator, and restricts key use to only allow for logical commands to the calculator per current state. Handles numbers up to 13 characters (including decimal) for entry, handles solutions up to (not including) 1e10, and accurately rounds to four decimal places per individual operation. Parsing of string to numerical evaluation can be executed on a chain of any length, and academically defined order of operation is followed utilizing a personally coded parser function that handles string format generated in this program. The GUI is meant to mimic a physical calculator.
